 Challenge: CLI Contact Book (CSV-Powered)                                                   
                                                                                             
Create a terminal-based contact book tool that stores and manages contacts using a CSV file. 
                                                                                             
Your program should:                                                                         
1. Ask the user to choose one of the following options:                                      
   - Add a new contact                                                                       
   - View all contacts                                                                       
   - Search for a contact by name                                                            
   - Exit                                                                                    
2. Store contacts in a file called `contacts.csv` with columns:                              
   - Name                                                                                    
   - Phone                                                                                   
   - Email                                                                                   
3. If the file doesn't exist, create it automatically.                                       
4. Keep the interface clean and clear.                                                       
                                                                                             
Example:                                                                                     
Add Contact                                                                                  
View All Contacts                                                                            
Search Contact                                                                               
Exit                                                                                         

Bonus:                                                                                       
- Format the contact list in a table-like view                                               
- Allow partial match search                                                                 
- Prevent duplicate names from being added
